Decentralized Voting App (Motoko + React + Vite)
Overview
This is a decentralized voting application built using Internet Computer's Motoko language for the backend and React with Vite for the frontend. It allows users to create polls, vote on them, view vote statistics, and delete pollsâ€”all stored on a decentralized canister.

Features
Create polls with multiple answer options.

Vote in polls (each principal can vote once).

View current results, including percentage breakdown.

Delete polls from the system (admin only or by implementation design).

Responsive, styled user interface with live state updates.

Poll results are displayed in both numeric and percentage form.

Deleting a poll removes it entirely from the canister state (ensure you have backups or confirmation logic).
